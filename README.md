# Astronomical Data Modelling and Interpretation
This Repository includes assignments given during the project Astronomical Data Modelling and Interpetation.
The google doc containing the personal progress is : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4FmYtGBDoHb6AEyv5qfevJUAJMuo6LhYjhUVn4sn3Q/edit?usp=sharing

WEEK 1

The answer for the rolling 2 die problem is in rolling2die.ipynb and for the strings lie in string_sort.ipynb. Here I have given a sample stringlist.csv file where sample input can be stored.The answer is in the pdf named answer.

WEEK2:

Learnt about pulsars, wrote programs to calculate median and mean of the data sets using numpy arrays. Learnt about astropy package and how from the image statistics and other calculations is done. I will soon add the programs I have written for the coursera activities in the github repository.

WEEK 3:

Learnt about blackholes,active galactic nuclei and how instead of euclidean distances projected angular distance is calculated. I wrote programs to calculate them.Further,learnt what cross matching algorithm and how to implement it. Further due to large time complexity I learnt how this problem can be solved by using astropy package the k-d tree.

WEEK 4:
Started with a brief intro about exoplanets and then about the SQL and various queries.Wrote SQL Queries for various purposes like finding out planets with radius/temperature specifications arranging in an ascending/descending order, grouping them in a particular order and other tasks to perform specific queries.
Then more sub queries were practised and how to join tables. I performed the various assignments in the external graded tool of the coursera which introduced me to the inner joining in SQL.Also, learnt about the life cycle of a star. Learned how to create a database by various insert update delete queries.

WEEK 5 &6 :
Mostly finished with the course. Learned new things about Machine Learning and built a regression classifier.Also learnt about scikit library in python, estimated reshifts  using techniques of regression. Next, also focussed on tuning dfork used to classify galaxies.It was new to learn about ensemble learning which uses multiple algorithms at the same time. Hence used random forests and also compared decision trees and random forests. Thus, concluding the course. I plan to watch the astrophysics lectures that have been shared by the mentor
