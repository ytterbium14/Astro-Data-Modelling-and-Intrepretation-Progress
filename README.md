# Astronomical Data Modelling and Interpretation
This Repository includes assignments given during the project Astronomical Data Modelling and Interpetation.
The google doc containing the personal progress is : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4FmYtGBDoHb6AEyv5qfevJUAJMuo6LhYjhUVn4sn3Q/edit?usp=sharing

WEEK 1

The answer for the rolling 2 die problem is in rolling2die.ipynb and for the strings lie in string_sort.ipynb. Here I have given a sample stringlist.csv file where sample input can be stored.The answer is in the pdf named answer.

WEEK2:

Learnt about pulsars, wrote programs to calculate median and mean of the data sets using numpy arrays. Learnt about astropy package and how from the image statistics and other calculations is done. I will soon add the programs I have written for the coursera activities in the github repository.

WEEK 3:

Learnt about blackholes,active galactic nuclei and how instead of euclidean distances projected angular distance is calculated. I wrote programs to calculate them.Further,learnt what cross matching algorithm and how to implement it. Further due to large time complexity I learnt how this problem can be solved by using astropy package the k-d tree.
