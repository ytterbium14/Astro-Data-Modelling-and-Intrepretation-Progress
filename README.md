This Repository includes assignments given during the project Astronomical Data Modelling and Interpetation.



## WEEK 1

The [answer for the rolling 2 die problem](https://github.com/ytterbium14/Astro-Data-Modelling-and-Intrepretation-Progress/blob/main/rolling2die.py) 
The strings lie in [string_sort.ipynb](https://github.com/ytterbium14/Astro-Data-Modelling-and-Intrepretation-Progress/blob/main/string_sort.py). Here I have given a sample stringlist.csv file where sample input can be stored.
The answer for the thought provoking question is [here](https://github.com/ytterbium14/Astro-Data-Modelling-and-Intrepretation-Progress/blob/main/answer.pdf).

## WEEK2:

Learnt about pulsars, wrote programs to calculate median and mean of the data sets using numpy arrays. Learnt about astropy package and how from the image statistics and other calculations is done. I will soon add the programs I have written for the coursera activities in the github repository.

## WEEK 3:

Learnt about blackholes,active galactic nuclei and how instead of euclidean distances projected angular distance is calculated. I wrote programs to calculate them.Further,learnt what cross matching algorithm and how to implement it. Further due to large time complexity I learnt how this problem can be solved by using astropy package the k-d tree.

## WEEK 4:
Started with a brief intro about exoplanets and then about the SQL and various queries.Wrote SQL Queries for various purposes like finding out planets with radius/temperature specifications arranging in an ascending/descending order, grouping them in a particular order and other tasks to perform specific queries.
Then more sub queries were practised and how to join tables. I performed the various assignments in the external graded tool of the coursera which introduced me to the inner joining in SQL.Also, learnt about the life cycle of a star. Learned how to create a database by various insert update delete queries.

## WEEK 5 &6 :
Finished the course. Learned new things about Machine Learning and built a regression classifier.Also learnt about scikit library in python, estimated reshifts  using techniques of regression. Next, also focussed on tuning dfork used to classify galaxies.It was new to learn about ensemble learning which uses multiple algorithms at the same time. Hence used random forests and also compared decision trees and random forests. Thus, concluding the course. I plan to watch the astrophysics lectures that have been shared by the mentor

## Week 6 onwards :

I started watching Prof. Varun Bhalerao’s astrophysics lectures that were shared. In all I have watched in all 13 lectures of the 24 shared, some were in an order the other were some topics that I found interesting while scrolling through the slides. Well from the beginning ,The things I learnt included-difference between astronomy and astrophysics, what stars are and how they are considered black bodies, Hertzsprung Russell Diagram and also studied stars with the help of GIT data. This was something new to me and I really liked it.
Then in Lecture 3,learnt more about the properties like mass ranges of the stars and the other stellar properties of the star. I learnt about stellar space and how the stellar classification is done. O B A F G K M L T is the spectral sequence. 
How the star is born which was preceded by the triple alpha process, the CNO cycle included on how gas pressure on . Heat transfer in the stars where the core is hotter and denser having the heavier elements and the lighter elements being in the outer layers. Evolution of stars followed with possibilities of older stars being hot/cool or large/small.Then comes the death of a star.
This was a pretty cool picture that I liked hence adding it :D
Isn’t science all about perception? For example, there is a grasshopper in the garden, a biologist would speak about the anatomy and say a physicist would talk about his motion and forces acting on it. (Perception)

Supernovae are basically the right explosion of a star which can shine brighter than the galaxy and the future of an offline semester ( sorry for the depressed covid batch humour) . Next was neutron stars, pulsars(had covered it in the data driven astronomy course as well). Black holes, the most intriguing, different types of stars followed it.Binaries, high mass x-ray gmrt binary formation of binary pulsars. Co-ordinate system

Also ran through the lecture on Astronomical detectors and the CCD images a little heavy yet fun to know.

Also this was among the ending lectures of the course but still I did it -introduction to asteroids and astrometry which covered why we need to study asteroids more technical intricate details on various techniques such as astrometry photometry spectroscopy radar was also covered.Another interesting lecture was of gravitational astronomy and high energy astrophysics.
